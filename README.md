# Software-managing-television-subscriptions
For a software engineering course we had to develop a software which managed television subscriptions. First of all we made use case diagram and UML diagram (TP1_cabloplus_CABANNES_DOVAN.docx). Afterwards we design the software's interfaces. Finally, we implemented the functionalities of this software, you cand find this in the folders : "InterfaceUtilisateur" and "Logique". A part of this code was generated with XLST generation, you can see this in the "Generation" folder. The files in the folder "AccessDonnees" establish a connection betweenn the software and a database, we used the data mapper pattern. We detail the implementation in the file TP3_cabloplus_CABANNES_DOVAN.docx.

# How to launch the project
